# Mermin-GHZ classical deterministic strategies simulation
This project is to enumerate the optimal classical strategies for players of the Mermin-GHZ pseudo-telepathy game.
The goal of the enumeration is to simulate the so called exclusion sets defined in my thesis for a nonlocal game, where
for a nonlocal game *G = <X, Y, A, B, p, W>*, 
the exclusion set is defined to be the set of inputs such that using a particular deterministic strategy will not satisfy the
winning condition *W*. ie.
*E = { x | W(x, s(x)) = 0 }*

The project is hosted locally as a jupyter file.
